# TDD-Unit-Testing-TS-LAB

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A hands-on lab exercise focused on practicing Test Driven Development (TDD) and unit testing in JavaScript using Jest. This project demonstrates how writing tests **before** implementation helps build reliable, maintainable applications through rigorous test coverage of individual app features and functions.

## Description

Test Driven Development (TDD) is an approach where tests are written **before** the code itself, guiding development and ensuring correctness from the start. Unit testing focuses on evaluating the smallest isolated components of an application. By applying unit TDD, I guarantee each function and feature performs as expected, leading to robust and predictable software.

---

## Features

- Demonstrates core TDD principles
- Automated white-box unit testing of individual JavaScript functions
- Ensures high code reliability and maintainability

---

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Jest (unit test framework)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/TDD-Unit-Testing-TS-LAB.git
    cd TDD-Unit-Testing-TS-LAB
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

---

## Usage

- Review or write unit tests in the `/tests` directory.
- Implement or modify JavaScript functions to pass all corresponding tests.
- Run tests with:
    ```
    npm test
    ```

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Strengthened discipline in writing tests before implementation.
- Improved skills in isolating logic into testable units.
- Gained confidence in code reliability through effective automated testing workflows.

---

## Future Improvements

- Increase test coverage for edge cases and integration scenarios.
- Add code coverage metrics.
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated test execution.
